Visualising six degrees of separation with imdb data

## Goal

Have a website interface to pick two actors, and then visualise the degrees of separation with d3 graph type visualisation.

## Steps

1. Create ES database
2. Download IMdB dataset
3. Injest data into ES
4. Write code to find paths between ActorA and ActorB
5. Visualise paths in d3 graph type visualisation.
6. Implement web interface *the great unknown..._

## ToDo

Well, all the above. Certain components have been tested, but need to go through step by step and do it properly.
Step 6 is the main one that illudes me at the moment.

## Contributions

Pull requests welcome :)
